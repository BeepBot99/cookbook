# Why to only use USB 3.0


### Ingredients


1. A Control Hub
2. At least 1 USB device
3. A USB hub (optional)


## The Recipe


### Overview
The Control Hub has a lot of nuances that many people do not know of, including the dangers of the onboard USB 2.0 port.

### The Problem
The Control Hub's USB 2.0 port shares a ground with the Wi-Fi chipset on the Control Hub.
This provides a path for a static shock to the USB device to cause a Wi-Fi disconnect mid-match.


### How to Mitigate the Problem
The best way to mitigate the problem is to not use the USB 2.0 port on your Control Hub.
For teams with no or only one USB device, that's not a problem, just use the USB 3.0 port instead of the USB 2.0 port.
If your team needs more than one device, such as an Expansion Hub over USB *and* a USB camera for object detection, it gets more complicated.
To prevent shock, you can get a USB hub and connect all devices through just the USB 3.0 port.
