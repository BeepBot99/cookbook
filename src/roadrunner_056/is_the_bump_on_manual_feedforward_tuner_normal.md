# Is the Bump On Manual Feedforward Tuner Normal?

Yes!
The bump when accelerating and decelerating is normal.
It is caused by a fundamental hardware issue with the Control and Expansion Hubs that makes deceleration weird.
There's nothing you can do about it; just try to get the plates and slopes to match up as closely as possible.
